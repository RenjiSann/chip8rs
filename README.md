# rs-chip8

---

A small chip8 emulator written in Rust.

I mainly used this [guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/).

I also got inspiration from [this implementation](https://github.com/Clotildelevou/CHIP8-emulator).

## TODO

- [ ] Implement a graphical interface instead of ascii drawing
- [ ] Handling inputs
- [ ] Handling timers
- [ ] Handling sound

I also try to organize my code the best possible, to learn how the module and crates system works.
